This project is to use a convoluted neural network on a dataset containing S&P1500 stock company fundamentals from the current date, as well as daily stock market history for each stock for the last 30 days. I need to adjust a few scripts I have using the massive RESTClient to get relevant stock history for a benchmark as well as for all stocks in the S&P1500 csv that is given

- you are allowed to suggest changes to existing code in order to make new functions work better
- always explain the reasoning before showing code
- when code may be complex, add inline comments to explain code
- do more explaining in the prompt response than in code comments
- never use any emojis in responses including code comments
- prioritize pandas when making changes to the existing data
- follow PEP8 standards for generated code
- do not suggest any module outside of yfinance and the massive RESTClient to get financial information
